# Project: Spring Social media blog API

## Background 

Full-stack applications are typically concerned with both a front end, that displays information to the user and takes in input, and a backend, that manages persisted information.

This project will be a backend for a hypothetical social media app, where we must manage our usersâ€™ accounts as well as any messages that they submit to the application. However, the functionality for this project will leverage a popular web application framework for Java known as Spring. The Spring framework allows for automatic injection and configuration of many features, including data persitence, endpoints and conventional data manipulation logic (CRUD operations).

In our hypothetical micro-blogging or messaging app, any user should be able to see all of the messages posted to the site, or they can see the messages posted by a particular user. In either case, we require a backend which is able to deliver the data needed to display this information as well as process actions like logins, registrations, message creations, message updates, and message deletions.
